# OnCampus frontend
## Requirements

`node v14.17.0 or higher`

`npm v6.14.13 or higher`

lower might work this is just what I am running

## How to run
Duplicate the example.env file and rename to .env, if for some reason you need the port 9241 locally, port 3000 is also configured to work (if you want another port let me know so that I can add it to the list of allowed URLs in our auth provider, Auth0)

Install dependencies using npm

`npm i`

Run the app 

`npm run start`

The page should auto-reload when you make changes
